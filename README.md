# Setup
Install npm
run `npm install`
If necessary, change the apiLocation variable in the environment.ts file to point to the api printed out when running the firestore function emulator. Likely nothing or only the port will need to be changed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Errors will be printed to the console if you have not started the functions and firestore emulators.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
