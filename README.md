# Setup
In dev mode both firestore and firebase function emulators are used.
Change the apiLocation variable in the environment.ts file to point to the api printed out when running the firestore emulators. Likely only the port will need to be changed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
